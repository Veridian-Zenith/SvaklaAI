# SvaklaAI

SvaklaAI is an ultra-refined, full-featured AI system designed to run on XP-era hardware while maintaining high-end features and capabilities. This project aims to provide a completely private, local-first AI solution with elite-level cognitive abilities.

## Features

- **Core Networking Systems**: Custom minimal HTTP, WebSocket, and API servers with full TLS support.
- **Authentication Systems**: Public/Private Key Auth and Argon2 hashed passphrase fallback.
- **Web-Based Local Control Panel**: Lightweight static HTML5/CSS/VanillaJS frontend.
- **AI Core Engine**: Advanced tokenizer, vectorizer, and dynamic logic/code generation modules.
- **External Service Interface**: Minimalist headless Firefox control via DBus bridge.
- **Plugin System**: Hot-loadable `.so` files with signature validation and memory isolation.
- **Local Memory Storage System**: Encrypted conversations stored locally with user-prompted custom path selection.
- **Interactive Shell**: Rich CLI frontend with color-coded intents/emotions and built-in personalities.
- **Monitoring and Safety Systems**: System resource tracker, syscall monitor, and clipboard monitor.
- **Advanced Low-Level Systems**: Inline assembler support, raw ELF binary construction, and disk raw writing modules.
- **Privacy and Security Enforcement**: Zero external send policy, audit-self command, and plugin sandbox.
- **Expansion Modules**: Vulkan-based GUI frontend, federated learning capability, BCI module, and neural graph visualizer.
- **Installation System**: Script to confirm system paths, verify networking components, install dependencies, and apply firewall profiles.
- **Documentation System**: Comprehensive documentation in the `/docs/` folder.
